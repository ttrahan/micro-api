# micro-api demo application

This is the back-end of a simple 2-tier app to demonstrate using Google Container Registry
(GCR) and Google Container Engine (GKE) with Shippable. To see the full functionality
of the app, use the same steps to deploy the front-end of the app which is also
on Aye0Aye called [micro-www](https://github.com/aye0aye/micro-www/tree/google-gcr-gke).

#### Prerequisites for running this sample:
1. Create a project called 'shippable-gke' within Google Cloud Platform
2. Fork the [aye0aye/micro-api](https://github.com/aye0aye/micro-api/tree/google-gcr-gke) repository, e.g. to your GitHub account
3. Log into Shippable and [enable a project for your fork](http://docs.shippable.com/ci_subscriptions/#enabling-a-project)
4. [Create an Account Integration for GCR](http://docs.shippable.com/int_docker_registries/#google-container-registry-gcr)
 called 'GCR-shippable-gke' and [assign it to your project](http://docs.shippable.com/ci_projects/#enabling-integrations)

 Note: In this sample, you will be working with branch "google-gcr-gke"

#### When run, the CI process performs the following:
* Uses Docker to build the CI environment from a Dockerfile, pulling the base
image from a public repository "aye0aye/micro-image"
* Executes some basic CI tests
* Stores the test results and code coverage report
* Upon successful CI build, pushes the newly built Docker image to Google Container Registry

#### Environment variables required for pulling and pushing from GCR in shippable.yml:
In the shippable.yml, you should't need to change any of the environment variables:
- SERVICE=micro-api
- PROJECT_ID=shippable-gke
- REGISTRY_ACCOUNT=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID
